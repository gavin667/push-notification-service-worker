# Service Worker


## Getting Started

Copy the `service-worker.js` file into the root of the publicly accessible directory that you want to allow the service worker access to.

You should tweak aspects of the `service-worker.js` per your project specifics.

Once the service worker is in place, you need to tell the browser to initiate the installation of the service worker, if the browser supports service workers. To do this copy the content from `app.js` and place into a javascript file that you are using in your project. Again certain aspects of the this file may need tweaked based on your project specifics.
